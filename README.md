# VB_Segmentation_Template_construct
A tool for combined medical image segmentation, registration and atlas constructon using Gaussian mixture models and a variational expectation-maximization algorithm.
Part of the algorithm is described in Blaiotta, Claudia, M. Jorge Cardoso, and John Ashburner. "Variational inference for medical image segmentation." Computer Vision and Image Understanding 151 (2016): 14-28.
